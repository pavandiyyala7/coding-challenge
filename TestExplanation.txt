To solve the given question i seperat the all possible blacks with seperation based on 
asking in reqs. After the seperation it like array in array.

To compare the blocks,i assumed all the blocks having same distant and taking the x,y,z variables.

verifying the blocks using comparision operators.

after the checking all blocks and it's distance taking possible blocks into a temp1 array.

from temp1 array i grt one of the block using for loop and return that value as function output.
